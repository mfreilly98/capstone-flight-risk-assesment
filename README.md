# Code Milestone 1

For code milestone one, we have a basic web application with a front end coded with React and a back end coded in spring. We have used a EC2 server from AWS to create our web page. Our end goal is to fully develop a flight risk assesment web application for UNO aviation students and professors. The flight risk assesment form will include useful NOTAMs and METAR data for the students so they are able to quickly determine the risk for taking the flight. For the professors, they will be able to go in and see what students have put into the assesment along with being able to change settings for the students. 

To run the application use command lines: \
npm install 
npm I react-bootstrap
npm start

Code for our project is currently in three branches: \
milestone_1_simonini
Admin_Panel
backend1

we intend to combine the code into 1 to 2 repositories soon.
